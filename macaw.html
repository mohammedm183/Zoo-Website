                Macaws are a group of New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful, in the tribe Arini. They are popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there are conservation concerns about several species in the wild. The majority of macaws are now endangered in the wild and a few are extinct. The Spix's macaw is now most likely extinct in the wild.
