    <p>Jaguars are the largest cat in the Western Hemisphere. 
        They live in swamps, tropical forests, and deserts.
        They have the strongest bite force of any big cat, capable of piercing turtle shells and skulls.
        Unlike many other cats, jaguars are not afraid of water and are excellent swimmers.
        Their diets consists of various species such as capybaras, peccaries, caimans,
        and reptiles.
