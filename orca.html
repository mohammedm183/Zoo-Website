                Orcas, also known as killer whales, are the largest member of the dolphin family, found in all of the world's ocean and known for their high intelligence, diverse diets, and complex social structures. They are the oceans apex predators, with no natural preditors of their own. Orcas are not inherently friendly or dangerous to humans; they are wild apex predators.
