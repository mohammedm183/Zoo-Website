    <h1>King Cobra</h1>
    <img src="images/king.jpg" alt="cobraKing" width="500">
    <p>King Cobras are large, venomous snakes native to Asia.
        They can kill and eat other cobras.
        They are the only snakes that build nests for their eggs and guard them fiercely.
        When threatened, they can "stand up," raising as much as one-third of their body off the ground.
        An adult King Cobra is yellow, green, black, or brown with yellow chevrons.
        They average around 10 to 12 feet but can reach up to 18 feet!  </p>
