    <p>The Red Pandas are native to the Eastern Himalays. They use their long, bushy tails as blankets to keep warm in cold weather.
        Despite their name, they are not closely related to giant pandas.
        Red Pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals who like to stay in trees.
    They are primarily harbivore and are considered endangered.  </p>
